# Client Change Log
Date: February 13, 2026
Project: SSSystem Prospects Module

## Summary
This update improves prospect navigation, visibility of external links, and consistency across Type/State/County browsing pages.

## Data Model Updates
- Added two new URL fields to Prospect:
  - ack_url
  - tdm_url

## Prospect List Page Updates (`templates/prospects/list.html`)
- Added ACK and TDM status columns using visual indicators:
  - Green check when URL exists
  - Red cross when URL is missing
- For admin users, ACK/TDM indicators open the related URL in a new tab.
- Reordered columns so ACK/TDM appear after Qualification.
- Changed navigation behavior:
  - Entire row is no longer clickable.
  - Case # is now the explicit link to prospect details.
- Improved Case # and Parcel ID link styling.
- Parcel ID now opens parcel_url in a new tab.
- If parcel_url is blank, fallback parcel link is generated using parcel_id (same logic as detail page).

## Prospect Detail Page Updates (`templates/prospects/detail.html`)
- Added ACK and TDM indicators in the Status card (after Qualification):
  - Green check when URL exists
  - Red cross when URL is missing
- For admin users, ACK/TDM checks open URLs in a new tab.
- Removed separate ACK/TDM card and moved this info into Status for better context.

## Search Results Page Updates (`templates/search_results.html`)
- Navbar search results for Prospects now show full list-style columns similar to Prospect List.
- Added support in search view for assigned user display (`assigned_to`).
- Preserved Cases results section and corrected table column integrity.

## State Select Page Updates (`templates/prospects/state_select.html`)
- Added a prospects list section below state cards with filters and pagination.
- Added State and County columns in this list.
- Default filter behavior:
  - Qualification defaults to Qualified unless user selects otherwise.
- State cards are clickable and apply state filter to the list.
- Removed "Show All States" behavior.
- Page now always shows only states with prospect counts.
- Updated state cards to improved visual layout (header/body/footer style).
- Added contextual icon actions in header:
  - Calendar icon opens calendar filtered by type + state.
  - Counties action shown as "View Counties" next to stats.
- Applied Bootstrap standard contextual colors to state card headers.

## County Select Page Updates (`templates/prospects/county_select.html`)
- Added a prospects list section below county cards with filters and pagination.
- Added State and County columns in this list.
- Default filter behavior:
  - Qualification defaults to Qualified unless user selects otherwise.
  - Selected state is pre-applied.
- County cards are clickable and apply county filter to the list.
- Removed "Show All Counties" behavior.
- Page now always shows only counties with prospect counts.
- Redesigned county cards with clearer header/body structure.
- Moved calendar action to a top-right icon in card header.
- Added location icon before county name.
- Applied Bootstrap standard contextual colors to county card headers.

## Type Select Page Updates (`templates/prospects/type_select.html`)
- Added a full prospects list section below type cards with filters and pagination.
- Added a Type filter control in the filter form.
- Added Type column in the list table.
- Type cards now include:
  - Qualified/Total stats
  - Calendar icon opening calendar pre-filtered by type
  - View States action
- Updated card styling to use Bootstrap standard color themes by type.
- Updated View States button color to match each type card theme.
- Added hover animation matching state-card behavior.

## Filters and View Logic Updates
- Enhanced shared ProspectFilter to support:
  - State filter
  - County filter (dependent on selected state)
- Updated view contexts (Type/State/County select pages) to provide:
  - Filter form context
  - Filtered prospect list
  - Pagination objects

## Notes
- All UI updates were implemented to keep behavior consistent between Type, State, County, and main Prospect List flows.
- Admin-only link opening behavior is preserved where required (ACK/TDM).
